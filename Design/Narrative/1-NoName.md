# NoName:

We don't name the character as it could be anyone (maybe two different sprites if men/woman?).

The character wakes up in the room, looks sort of a friendly place but a bit unsettling

At first, all interactions are possible, then the objects are going to slightly disappear



Going back to each dream make the player less connected to the reality, until there is nothing left



I want the character to question the nature of what's real or not



At the end, when going out the room, there is only empty space all around

If the player explore a bit far, the room disappears and the name of the game appears
