# Dreams:

Contrary to the room which is familiar and with a warm atmosphere, I want the dreams to be dark

Maybe not a lot of visibility



We are constently being attacked with some monster, silhouette

The first dream, being catch is unavoidable (SCRIPTED: :D)



Then, we are going further into (descent) to the dream and some eyes appear, seems to track us

Sometimes, the eyes widen and look to the monster direction just before an attack

Then, the loght blink and we enter purchase mode (with music)
