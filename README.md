# Lil Dream


You are waking up in your chamber without remembering anything about your life. You can only try to explore the place and go back to sleep in order to learn some things about you ... Or reality!

But careful, your dreams will put up a fight! And as you slowly lose against yourself, you also loose touch with reality...

Try you best to escape this reality!


Enjoy,
Quack
